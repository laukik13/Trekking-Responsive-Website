                <p>At [Your Trekking Company], we understand that plans can change, and sometimes it     becomes necessary to cancel or reschedule a trekking trip. This Cancellation Policy outlines     the terms and conditions for canceling or modifying your trek booking with us. Please read     this policy carefully before making your reservation. </p>
                
                <p><b>Cancellation by Participants:</b></p>

                <p>1.1. Cancellation Prior to Departure: <br/>
                    If you wish to cancel your trekking trip before the departure date, the following cancellation   charges will apply based on the notice period:  
                    More than [X] days prior to departure: [X]% of the trekking fee will be retained as      administrative charges, and the remaining amount will be refunded.   
                    to [Y] days prior to departure: [Y]% of the trekking fee will be retained, and the balance will be refunded.   
                    [Z] days or less prior to departure: No refund will be provided.
                </p>
                <p>1.2. No Shows:<br/>
                    If you fail to join the trek on the scheduled departure date without prior notice, no refunds will be issued.
                </p>
                <p>1.3. Trek Changes or Postponements: <br/>  
                    If you wish to modify your trekking trip to an alternative date or different trek, we will do     our best to accommodate your request based on availability. However, if the changes result     in additional costs or fees (e.g., permits, accommodations), you will be responsible for covering these expenses.
                </p>

                <p><b>Cancellation by [Your Trekking Company]:</b></p>
                <p>2.1. Trip Cancellation: <br/>  
                    In the unlikely event that we have to cancel a trek due to reasons beyond our control (e.g.,    natural disasters, political unrest, insufficient participants), we will offer alternative trek     options or provide a full refund of the trekking fee paid by the participant. We will not be    liable for any other costs incurred by the participant, such as flight or accommodation bookings.
                </p>

                <p>2.2. Itinerary Changes: <br/>  
                    We strive to adhere to the planned itinerary as much as possible. However, trekking in     remote areas may involve unexpected challenges (e.g., weather conditions, health issues,    group dynamics) that could lead to itinerary modifications. In such cases, we will make    reasonable efforts to provide equivalent alternatives.
                </p>

                <p><b>Booking Amendments:</b></p>
                <p>3.1. Changing Trek Dates: <br/>  
                    If you wish to change your trek date after confirmation, we will try to accommodate your     request based on availability. A one-time fee of [X] will be charged for any trek date change.
                </p>

                <p>3.2. Transferring Bookings: <br/>  
                    You may transfer your booking to another person who meets all the requirements for the     trek. A transfer fee of [X] will apply for this service.
                </p>

                <p><b>Refunds:</b></p>
                <p>4.1. Refund Process:<br/>
                    Refunds will be processed within [X] business days after receiving a written     cancellation request from the participant.
                </p>

                <p>4.2. Refund Method: <br/>  
                    Refunds will be made using the same payment method used for the original booking, unless     otherwise agreed upon by both parties.   
                </p>
                <p><b>Travel Insurance:</b> <br/>
                    We strongly recommend that all participants purchase comprehensive travel insurance that    covers trip cancellation, medical expenses, and emergency evacuation for the duration    of the trek.   
                    By confirming your trekking reservation with [Your Trekking Company], you acknowledge    that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions of this Cancellation    Policy.
